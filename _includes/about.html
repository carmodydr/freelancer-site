        <p>My interests and pursuits are often rooted in the narrative of science and exploration of the natural world, especially exploring the intricate relationships between ecology and technology. I aim to re-establish a profound connection to nature, starting from the ground up, by seeking fresh perspectives on the natural beauty found in my immediate surroundings.
	<!--         </p><p>Through the utilization of digital tools and data processing, I strive to create personalized conservation art and products. We harness publicly available data to explore the interconnections between the natural world and the built environment, unveiling innovative ways to forge personal relationships between individuals and their surroundings. My goal is to breathe life into the natural world, making it vivid and tangible through creative applications of technology. -->
